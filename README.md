# Advent-Of-Code

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about). "*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.*"
