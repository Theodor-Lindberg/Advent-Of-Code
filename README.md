# Advent-Of-Code

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about). "*Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.*"

I wrote all my solutions for 2018 in the same file (over writing them each day) because I didn't think I wanted to save them so I will try to recreate them. I will also do some of the previous years challenges.

Note that these are solutions from trying to solve the puzzles as fast as possible, therefor some suboptimal decisions may have been made or that the solutions does not directly output the answer but I found it anyway. Perhaps I rewrite some of the solutions in a different file.
